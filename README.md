# Wemorize [WIP]
**Wemorize** is a Node.js-based, self-hostable web application that aims to provide a platform for users to:
* Create and share decks of flashcards (Courses)
* Join courses and effectively learn the material provided
* Stay motivated and consistent throughout their learning journey
* Compare their achievements to other members of the community

Instances may be public, allowing everyone to register and learn together, or private for enterprise use.

This is currently a work in progress and should NOT be used in production environments.
